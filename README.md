Intervalometer
=====

This is the project that attracted me to Arduino in the first place.  I wanted to try my hand at time lapse photography but couldn't understand why I needed to buy an expensive camera controller (called an 'Intervalometer') when it was little more than some simple timing calculations and a switch to trigger the remote control of my digital SLR.
